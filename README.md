This repository is a set of Terraform modules for defining IAM resources.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to get the modules and running is by creating a Terraform definition for it, copy this snippet in a file
named `main.tf`:

```hcl
module "asg-server-role" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/tierratelematics/terraform-aws-iam.git//modules/role?ref=0.2.0"

  project     = "${var.project}"
  environment = "${var.environment}"
  subject     = "backend-asg"

  principals = [
    "ec2.amazonaws.com",
  ]

  actions = [
    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents",
    "logs:Describe*",
    "logs:PutRetentionPolicy",
    "ec2:Describe*",
  ]
}
```
## More Examples

### Existing Policies

When you already have an existing AWS managed policy you can attach it to the role using the `policies` argument:

```hcl
module "asg-server-role" {

  ...

  policies = [
    "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess",
    "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole",
  ]
}
```

### New Custom Policy

If you need a very focused custom policy for your role all you have to do is specify a list of required actions:

```hcl
module "asg-server-role" {

  ...

  actions = [
    "logs:CreateLogGroup",
    "logs:CreateLogStream",
    "logs:PutLogEvents",
    "logs:Describe*",
    "logs:PutRetentionPolicy",
    "ec2:Describe*",
  ]
}
```
